# Intrlink - Product Requirements Document

## Product Overview

Intrlink is a web application that revolutionizes how businesses manage and interact with their Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). The platform enables businesses to upload their SOPs, chat with them using AI, improve them through intelligent analysis, and eventually automate their updates.

Most businesses suffer from poor knowledge management:
- SOPs are outdated, confusing, and unorganized
- Documentation is scattered across multiple platforms
- Many businesses haven't even written down their processes
- New hires, partners, and even existing team members struggle to understand procedures
- This kills team effectiveness and slows business operations

### Solution

Intrlink provides a comprehensive knowledge management platform that:
- Centralizes all business documentation in one place
- Enables natural language interaction with SOPs through AI chat
- Analyzes and improves existing documentation
- Sets up systems for automatic context collection
- Makes businesses truly ready for AI integration

## Core Value Proposition

"We built AI that actually knows your business. Intrlink is the missing layer between your team and your tools. We make every operator 10x smarter, every decision 10x faster, and your company actually ready for AI."
